### Project Descriptions
SleepInc has provided you with an anonymized sleep and lifestyle metrics dataset for 374 individuals. This dataset contains average values for each person calculated over the past six months. The data is saved as sleep_health_data.csv.
The dataset includes 13 columns covering sleep duration, quality, disorders, exercise, stress, diet, demographics, and other factors related to sleep health.
